    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="description">Kitfo Beef Tartare is a common dish usually found on an Ethiopian
        sharing platter. It is raw high-quality beef that’s finely minced 
        and seasoned with spices and clarified butter. The taste is savory 
        and salty; perfect umami with a wonderfully soft melt-in-your-mouth
        texture.</p>

    <p class="description">You can serve Kitfo as a true raw steak tartare, or give it a quick sear
        in a hot skillet to partially cook it. Either way you’ll certainly want
        to enjoy fresh and meaty beef tartare as a special dish alongside a
        bounty of east African-inspired sides!</p>
