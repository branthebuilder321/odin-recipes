    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="description">Hiyaw Gebreyohannes' recipe for Awaze Tibs is especially saucy — all the
        better for mopping up with injera, Ethiopia's soft, fermented crêpe-like
        bread. Awaze, which translates to "spicy simmer sauce” in the Ethiopian
        language of Amharic, is a staple of Ethiopian cooking. It is used in
        braises like this one, and as a dipping sauce for grilled or roasted
        meats, seafood, and vegetables. It is seasoned with berbere. 
        Berbere is a spice blend integral to Ethiopian cooking that 
        commonly includes spicy peppers, cardamom, cumin, fenugreek, 
        allspice, cinnamon, and clove.</p>

    <p class="description">Gebreyohannes uses lamb for this recipe, but you can make it with beef
        instead; try a quick-cooking cut, such as sirloin. Serve this with 
        injera, naan, pita, or other flatbread, or with rice or couscous.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="centered-list ingredients">

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol class="centered-list steps">

            berbere, paprika, and mustard.</li>
        <li>Season the lamb with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Add the onions, garlic, rosemary, thyme, and a 
            generous pinch each of salt and pepper to the casserole 
            and cook over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until 
            the onions have softened, about 8 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
